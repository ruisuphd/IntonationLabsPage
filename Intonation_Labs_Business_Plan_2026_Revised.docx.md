## **4.1 AI Consulting Market**

The global AI consulting market continues to grow rapidly as businesses accelerate AI adoption. In Singapore specifically, the government has invested over S$25 billion through the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 plan, with an aim to triple the AI workforce to 15,000 practitioners.

### **Singapore AI Consulting Rate Benchmarks**

| Consultant Level | Hourly Rate (SGD) | Hourly Rate (USD) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Junior (0–3 years) | S$95–S$150 | $70–$110 |
| Mid-Level (3–7 years) | S$150–S$250 | $110–$185 |
| Senior / PhD-Level | S$250–S$350 | $185–$260 |
| Niche Specialist (Audio ML, RT) | S$300–S$500+ | $220–$370+ |
| GenAI / LLM Specialist | S$250–S$450+ | $185–$330+ |

### **Key Market Drivers**

* Singapore positions itself as Asia’s AI hub with massive government investment

* Critical AI talent shortage creates a seller’s market for qualified professionals

* Explosive demand for GenAI/RAG/Agentic AI expertise — most companies lack internal capability

* ML Engineers in Singapore earn S$120,000–S$200,000+ annually, making consulting rates of S$200–S$350/hr competitive

* Growing demand for production ML deployment (not just model training)

## **4.2 Generative AI Market Opportunity**

The generative AI market represents the fastest-growing segment within AI consulting. Enterprises across Southeast Asia are actively seeking consultants who can build production-grade RAG systems, integrate LLMs into existing workflows, and design agentic AI architectures. Most companies have experimented with ChatGPT or similar tools but lack the engineering depth to deploy custom GenAI solutions.

Key opportunity areas include: RAG-based knowledge management systems for enterprises, AI agent workflows for customer support and operations, LLM integration into existing software products, and prompt engineering strategy and optimisation.

## **4.3 Music Education Technology Market**

The global online music education market is projected to grow from US$23.53 billion in 2026 to US$101.39 billion by 2035, with over 40% of learners now preferring digital platforms.

### **Competitive Landscape**

| Competitor | Monthly Users | Price | Key Strength | Key Gap |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Yousician | 20M+ | $14.99–$19.99/mo | Market leader, gamified | No NLP coaching or technique analysis |
| Singing Carrots | Growing | Freemium | True AI coaching | Voice only, desktop-focused |

| Month 4–6 | S$5,000–S$10,000/mo | S$5,000–S$15,000 (total) | S$1,000–S$3,000/mo | S$0 | S$6,000–S$18,000 |

## **12.4 Year 1 Financial Summary — Revised**

| Metric | Conservative | Optimistic |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Total Consulting Revenue | S$80,000 | S$150,000 |
| Total GenAI Project Revenue | S$25,000 | S$65,000 |
| Total Workshop & Digital Product Revenue | S$17,000 | S$39,000 |
| Total Product Revenue (IntonationAI) | S$2,000 | S$10,000 |
| **Total Revenue** | **S$124,000** | **S$264,000** |
| Total Expenses | S$80,000 | S$96,000 |
| **Net Income** | **S$44,000** | **S$168,000** |
| Capital Remaining (end of Y1) | S$145,000+ | S$265,000+ |

**Key improvement vs. original plan:** The addition of GenAI consulting, workshops, and digital products increases the conservative Year 1 revenue estimate from S$82,000 to S$124,000 (+51%) and the optimistic estimate from S$160,000 to S$264,000 (+65%). Critically, the conservative scenario now shows meaningful net positive income (S$44,000 vs. S$2,000), significantly improving financial resilience.

## **12.5 Break-Even Analysis**

At a monthly burn rate of S$7,000 and blended consulting/workshop rate of S$220/hr equivalent, break-even requires approximately 32 billable hours per month. This is achievable with 1–2 active consulting engagements. Digital product revenue further reduces the break-even threshold over time.

# **13\. Grant & Funding Strategy**

## **13.1 Important Eligibility Note**

**The Startup SG Founder (SSGF) grant requires applicants to be Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents. As an Employment Pass holder, the founder is NOT eligible for SSGF. The grant strategy has been revised accordingly.**

## **13.2 Eligible Grants**

| Grant | Amount | Purpose | Timeline |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Startup SG Tech (POC) | Up to S$250,000 | Proof-of-concept for IntonationAI | Month 4–6 application |
| Startup SG Tech (POV) | Up to S$500,000 | Proof-of-value / market validation | Month 8–12 application |
| Enterprise Development Grant | Up to 50% of costs | Capability building, innovation | Month 6+ application |
| IMDA Accreditation | Market access | Credibility for government clients | Month 8+ application |

## **13.3 Other Funding Sources**

* Angel investors in Singapore’s music-tech or edtech space

* Revenue from consulting (primary self-funding mechanism)

* Potential accelerator programmes (SGInnovate, Antler, Entrepreneur First)

## **13.4 EP / Immigration Considerations**

Critical risk: As 100% shareholder and sole director, MOM may redirect the EP application to EntrePass. The founder must discuss shareholding structure with Sleek’s immigration team before EP submission. Fallback options include EntrePass and Tech.Pass.

EP minimum qualifying salary from January 2025 is S$5,600/month. The COMPASS framework requires at least 40 points across salary, qualifications, diversity, and local employment criteria. Companies with fewer than 25 PMETs receive default 10 points each for diversity and local employment.

# **14\. Risk Analysis & Mitigation**

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| EP application rejected by MOM | High | Medium | Discuss with Sleek before submission; prepare EntrePass fallback; consider nominee director structure |
| No consulting clients in first 6 months | High | Medium | Start LinkedIn content immediately; register on Toptal/Upwork; leverage PhD network; accept smaller initial projects; workshops as lead generation |
| GenAI market commoditisation | Medium | Medium | Focus on production deployment (not just prototypes); combine GenAI with niche audio ML expertise; build case studies fast |
| Solo founder burnout (PhD \+ business) | Medium | High | Phased rollout; MVP-first approach; 8hr/day allocation; hire contractors when revenue permits |
| IntonationAI fails to gain traction | Medium | Medium | Validate with beta users before full build; consulting sustains business regardless; pivot product if needed |
| Yousician or similar adds LLM coaching | Medium | Medium | Move fast on LLM coaching as first-mover; build community and brand loyalty; focus on underserved SEA market |
| Technical complexity exceeds solo capacity | Medium | Medium | Hire part-time contractors for frontend/design; focus founder time on ML core; use open-source components |
| Funding delays (grants take 6–12 months) | Low | High | Self-funded with 24-month runway; consulting revenue as primary funding; grants are bonus, not dependency |
| IP dispute with Maynooth University | High | Low | Founder confirms full IP ownership; IntonationAI is separate codebase; document IP provenance clearly |
